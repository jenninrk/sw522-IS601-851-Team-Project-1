**Git Definitions**
  * Repository
    * The repository is the central storage location for your project.  It is the original project file from which clones will be created and worked on by developers.  As sections of the project are refined and updated, the changes approved by the project owner(s) will be updated to this central repository.  Once the entire repository is fully fleshed out, the project will be finished.
  * Clone
    * The clone is a local copy of the project contained within the repository on which the developer will work.  It is warehoused on the developer’s computer, typically in a directory with the nomenclature your-name/your-repo.  This file is sometimes referred to as a “working directory” or a “working tree".
    •	Fork
o	Allows the developer to contribute to a public repository without potentially damaging work done on the main repository by creating a copy of the main repository on the developer’s computer, and under the developer’s account. Once forked, the developer must clone the forked project in order to manipulate it. 
•	Branch
o	A branch, or branches, are often made within a developer’s local copy, to allow them to test strategies or edits before committing changes to the main code in the master repository. 
•	Commit
o	This command will record the changes made in the local branch back to the master repository.
